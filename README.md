### About the Starter Project
The included starter project represents a new Unity project where the following have been done:
- All assets needed to complete the project according to the project rubric have been imported.
- The imported models have been placed in the scene and organized in the scene hierarchy.
- Colliders have been added to the `Coin`, `Key`, `Left_Door`, `Right_Door`, and `The_Temple` game objects, and to the `Maze` game object's child game objects.

### Notes
This project was built for Android. The goal of this project was to create a maze game, traversable by waypoints, with at least 5 collectatble coins and a key to unlock a door with a sign that declares the win state and restarts the game. The main scene is the scene called Main, located at Assets > UdacityVR > Scenes.
